# notes
### these notes are posted so claims of me self-teaching data science and machine learning can be verified 

This is the repo for all my notes which I post online 

* data science
* machine learning
* linear algebra 




#### since im COGS, I dont have priority enrollment for CMPT. This is basically a death sentence because avg grad time for CMPT is 6 years. Due to this, im self teaching data science, machin learning, and likely a good hand full of stats.
