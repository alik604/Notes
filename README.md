# notes
### these notes are posted so claims of me self-teaching data science and machine learning can be verified 

This is the repo for all my notes which I post online 

* data science
* machine learning
* linear algebra 




#### since im COGS, I dont have priority enrollment for CMPT. This is basically a death sentence because avg grad time for CMPT is 6 years, let alone factoring in that I cant get into so desirable classes such as: operating systems, Database Systems I, Introduction to Computer Systems, and Introduction to Software Engineering. Due to this, im self teaching data science, machin learning, and likely a good hand full of stats, in hopes of staying competive. for what its worth, im begining my 3nd calendar years and taking 1 third year CMPT class which is called"cybersecurity", but it should have been called "data analytics with applications to intruder detection"
