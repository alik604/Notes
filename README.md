#### These notes are posted so claims of me self-teaching data science and machine learning can be verified 

This is the repo for all my notes which I post online

##### Since I'm COGS, I dont have priority enrollment for CMPT. This is basically a death sentence because avg grad time for CMPT is 6 years, let alone factoring in that I cant get into so desirable classes such as: operating systems, Database Systems I, Introduction to Computer Systems, and Introduction to Software Engineering. Due to this, im self teaching data science, machin learning, and likely a good hand full of stats, in hopes of staying competive. for what its worth, im begining my 3nd calendar years and taking one third year CMPT class which is called "cybersecurity", but it should have been called "data analytics with applications to intruder detection"
